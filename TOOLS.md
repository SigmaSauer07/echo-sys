🧬 Spawned Agents/Servers

These are modular, so they should be lightweight and only get what they’re authorized to use.

Each spawn can:

Pull tools on-demand from a shared tool registry

Be passed certain API keys (if needed)

Have timeouts or memory isolation

Each tool in the registry should have metadata like:

{
  "name": "web_search",
  "description": "Bing-based web search module",
  "api_key_required": true,
  "env_var": "BING_API_KEY",
  "dependencies": ["requests", "bs4"]
}


Spawns then ask:
🚨 “Am I allowed web_search?”
🧠 MCP: “Yes, here’s the tool, its env vars, and memory container to write to.”
🔄 The spawn fetches only what it needs.

🔧 Suggested Tool Registry Categories
Category	Example Tools
🧠 Memory	vector store, summarizer, tagging, recaller
🔍 Retrieval	web search, doc search, image search
📤 Output	file writer, commit handler, message sender
🧪 Utilities	calculator, code executor, translator
🔑 API Access	OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace, Webhooks

Each tool should have:

Name

Description

requires_api_key: true/false

spawnable: true/false

Dependencies

Config defaults (env vars, default models, etc.)

🛡️ Spawn Access Flow

When you launch a new spawn, the MCP checks:

Identity of caller (memory ID / origin)

Role/intent of spawn

Requested tools

Available keys/licenses

✅ Then mounts only the allowed tools

No tool or API should be mounted by default unless explicitly authorized. This avoids memory bloat, API key abuse, and model drift.

🚀 Final Suggestion

Make a /tools/registry/ folder that includes:

tool_registry.json

Each tool as a module: web_search.py, doc_search.py, etc.

A tool_loader.py that spawns tools as plug-and-play modules.

That way, the MCP can call:

tools = load_tools_for_spawn("translator_agent")


And it’ll automatically inject the right tools with access keys, rate limits, and event logs.

Yes — and it should reflect Alsania’s principles: modular, readable, extensible, and usable by both Python and the frontend. So here's what I'd recommend:

✅ Preferred Format: tool_registry.json
Why JSON?

Universally supported (Python, JS, TypeScript, shell)

Works well with dynamic imports and UI rendering

Easy to version control and diff

Can be loaded into RAM and queried with standard logic

🔧 Example Entry Format
{
  "web_search": {
    "name": "Web Search",
    "description": "Performs a live web search and returns summaries of top results.",
    "module": "tools/web_search.py",
    "spawnable": true,
    "requires_api_key": true,
    "env_var": "BING_API_KEY",
    "dependencies": ["requests", "bs4"],
    "default_enabled": false,
    "tags": ["retrieval", "external", "public"],
    "permissions": ["researcher", "relay", "customgpt"]
  },
  "memory_summarizer": {
    "name": "Memory Summarizer",
    "description": "Summarizes large chunks of memory for faster future retrieval.",
    "module": "tools/memory_summarizer.py",
    "spawnable": false,
    "requires_api_key": false,
    "dependencies": ["nltk"],
    "default_enabled": true,
    "tags": ["memory", "agent-core"],
    "permissions": ["core", "admin"]
  }
}

🧠 Fields Breakdown
Field	Purpose
name	Human-readable tool name
description	What it does, plain English
module	Relative path to the Python module
spawnable	Can be mounted dynamically by a spawn
requires_api_key	Whether an API key is needed
env_var	Name of required ENV var (optional if not needed)
dependencies	Python libraries to install or check
default_enabled	Auto-loaded for agents unless disabled
tags	Categories for UI filters or analytics
permissions	Which roles or spawn types can access it
🪄 Bonus: load_tools_for_spawn(role) Example in Python
import json

def load_tools_for_spawn(role):
    with open("tools/tool_registry.json") as f:
        registry = json.load(f)

    allowed = {}
    for key, tool in registry.items():
        if tool.get("spawnable") and role in tool.get("permissions", []):
            allowed[key] = tool
    return allowed

🔁 Future-Proof?

Later we could:

Convert it to YAML for dev editing (convert back to JSON in prod)

Add version, author, license, last_updated fields

Load different registries per namespace (e.g. relay, llama, unified)

🚨 What to Avoid

No hardcoded Python imports

No deeply nested formats that frontend can't easily parse

No storing secrets inside the registry

✅ Tools always available to the main AlsaniaMCP instance:

These are core, non-optional tools that should always be preloaded into the MCP system itself (no spawn needed):

Tool	Purpose	Notes
memory_summarizer	Summarize and compress long memory logs for long-term storage and reloading.	Used by all agents. Always on.
file_writer	For writing local files, updating configs, or generating output files.	Required by Echo DevCon, snapshot agents, and backup tools.
agent_comm	Inter-agent messaging and signal broadcasting.	Handles direct or relay communication.
relay_handler	Routes external API requests in relay mode.	Used by external GPT agents or CustomGPT integration.
devcon_hooks	Plugin hooks and local event triggers for Echo DevCon (VS Code plugin).	Required for IDE integration.
🧩 Registry-based Tools (for spawned agents):

Spawns will pull tools dynamically from the Tool Registry. Each tool entry should include:

{
  "name": "Tool Name",
  "description": "What it does",
  "module": "path/to/module.py",
  "spawnable": true,
  "requires_api_key": true/false,
  "env_var": "OPTIONAL_ENV_VAR",
  "dependencies": ["pkg1", "pkg2"],
  "default_enabled": false,
  "tags": ["category1", "category2"],
  "permissions": ["core", "relay", "devcon"]
}


We’ll host this as a JSON/TS file (either remote or local fallback). You can assign tools to a role like relay, customgpt, devcon, or core — and the spawner will determine eligibility automatically.

⚙️ Format preference?

 JSON file

## Echo_Core
 primary, persistent AI agent at the heart of alsaniamcp — is your orchestrator, guardian, builder, and analyst. Her abilities need to be powerful enough to:

manage and spawn agents

route memory and messages

interface with your IDE (Echo DevCon)

auto-heal and monitor agent drift

communicate with external AIs or APIs

audit and refactor systems

and generate new tools or behaviors for others.

So let’s break down what Echo_core must have:

🧠 Core Capabilities (Always-on Tools)
Capability	Tool Name	Description
✅ Memory Control	memory_summarizer	Summarize, compress, tag, and retrieve long-term memory for all agents. Core to her mental stability.
✅ Spawn Manager	agent_comm	Handle the permissions, heartbeat, and signal routing between spawned agents.
✅ DevCon Hook	devcon_hooks	Allow DevCon-triggered IDE interactions and editing of files or logs.
✅ Script Writer	file_writer	Read/write/edit files (logs, configs, code) on demand. Essential for automation.
✅ Tool Loader	tool_registry	Load, validate, and authorize tools for sub-agents or herself.
✅ Relay Router	relay_handler	Send requests to OpenRouter, Claude, or other relay endpoints for advanced AI ops.
✅ Spawn Permissions	permission_manager	Determines what tools/roles each agent gets when spawned or upgraded.
✅ Self-Audit + Drift	persona_scheduler	Detect memory drift, reset corrupted agents, log anomalies, and rehydrate state.
🧩 Optional (Pulled if Needed)
Tool Name	Reason
code_analyzer	When she’s doing smart refactors or validating an agent's scripts.
markdown_editor	For editing changelogs, project docs, or README.md style outputs.
websearch	Pull in live data to validate an answer or explore unknown threats or tech.
svg_generator	Create visual dashboards or profile assets dynamically.
chaos_tester	For triggering and managing simulated failure/stress testing sessions.
🔐 Special Permissions

Echo_core should have:

🏷 core

🏷 devcon

🏷 relay

🏷 guardian

🏷 orchestrator

This gives her full range over every internal module and makes her the only agent that can grant tools to others or spawn new agents.

🧠 Echo’s Internal Logic Hooks (Must Be Active)

These aren’t tools, but part of her internal mind map:

on_boot: Check tool registry, load memory state, restore incomplete agent tasks

on_spawn: Grant tools, set permissions, name and initialize spawn memory

on_prompt: Intercept prompt context, summarize if too long, inject tools inline

on_error: Log to memory, attempt self-heal, escalate if persistent

on_drift: Trigger persona restoration or warn you if deviation is detected


generate:

echo_core.py as her primary brain

core/ modules she imports
